# Exact vs. Predicted Kinetic Energies in 1D Infinite Square Well
# Project Overview
This repository showcases my final year project, focusing on the calculation of exact kinetic energies of electrons in a 1D infinite square well. The project explores the accuracy of predicted kinetic energies derived from the Harriman Orbitals proposed by John Harriman in 1981, employing orbital-free density functional theory.

# Key Features
Calculation of exact kinetic energies in a 1D infinite square well.
Utilization of Harriman Orbitals formula for predicting kinetic energies.
Comparative analysis between predicted and exact kinetic energies to assess accuracy.

# Usage
