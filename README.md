# Final-Year-Project-1DISW
This repository showcases part of my final year project, focusing on the calculation of exact kinetic energies of electrons in a 1D infinite square well. The project explores the accuracy of predicted kinetic energies derived from the Harriman Orbitals proposed by John Harriman in 1981, employing orbital-free density functional theory.
